# PYTHON BASICS AND DATA MANIPULATION
# Python Programming and Data Analytics: Weeks 1-4

## Objectives
- Learn Python programming basics.
- Practice data manipulation using Python, NumPy, and Pandas.
- Implement basic Python scripts for data processing and visualization.

---

## Week 1: Introduction to Python Programming

### Theory
- Python variables and data types
- Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
- Input/Output operations
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)

### Hands-On
- Temperature converter
- Basic calculator programs
- Other simple Python exercises

### Client Project
- Created a basic data processing script to calculate average temperature.

### Submission
- Python scripts
- Summary of concepts learned

---

## Week 2: Data Structures and Functions

### Theory
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets
- Functions and lambda functions
- Recursion
- List comprehensions

### Hands-On
- Worked with data structures
- Wrote functions for transformations (e.g., sum of squares, filtering)

### Client Project
- Data cleaning script: removed duplicates and filtered unwanted data

### Submission
- Python scripts
- Summary of concepts learned

## Week 3: NumPy and Pandas for Data Manipulation

### Theory
- NumPy arrays and operations
- Broadcasting in NumPy
- Pandas Series and DataFrames
- Indexing, selection, and filtering in Pandas
- Grouping and aggregation in Pandas

### Hands-On
- NumPy operations (element-wise addition, multiplication, mean, sum)
- Pandas DataFrame creation, filtering, missing value handling, and grouping

### Client Project
- Cleaned dataset by removing missing values
- Calculated averages per group using `groupby` and aggregation

### Submission
- Python scripts
- Summary of concepts learned

## Week 4: Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

### Theory
- Matplotlib basics: line plots, bar charts, histograms, scatter plots
- Seaborn advanced plots: histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, pairplots
- Plot customization: titles, labels, legends, colors

### Hands-On
- Created visualizations to analyze datasets
- Explored distributions and relationships between features

### Client Project
- Created a mini-dashboard:
  - Scatter plots for feature relationships
  - Histograms for distributions
  - Boxplots for category comparisons

### Submission
- Python scripts
- Plots
- Summary of concepts learned
