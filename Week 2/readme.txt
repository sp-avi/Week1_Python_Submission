# Week 2: Data Structures and Functions

## Concepts Learned
- Lists: Ordered, mutable collections
- Tuples: Ordered, immutable collections
- Dictionaries: Key-value pairs
- Sets: Unordered collections of unique items
- Functions: Reusable code blocks
- Lambda functions: Anonymous inline functions
- Recursion: Functions calling themselves
- List Comprehension: Short syntax for creating lists

## Hands-On Practice
- Calculated sum of squares of numbers
- Filtered even numbers from a list
- Implemented recursive factorial function

## Client Project
- Created a data cleaning script that:
  - Removes duplicates
  - Filters out None, empty, and whitespace-only values

This folder contains Python scripts implementing the above concepts.
